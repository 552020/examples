# Basic Bitcoin Example

This project showcases a very basic example of how to write a canister
that can receive and send Bitcoin.

The example leverages the [ECDSA API](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-ecdsa_public_key)
and [Bitcoin API](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-bitcoin-api) of the Internet Computer.

This example is extensively documented in the following tutorials:

* [Deploying Your First Bitcoin Dapp](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/functionality/bitcoin/deploying-your-first-bitcoin-dapp/)
* [Developing Bitcoin Dapps Locally](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/functionality/bitcoin/local-development/)
